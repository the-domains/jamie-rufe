  I frickin' love this book. Out of all of the business books I've read in the
  past 2 years, Pitch Anything is by far my favorite. I've read it
  cover-to-cover two times and I've referred back to countless times. It's been
  especially valuable to me recently as I've started to pitch my services to
  prospective clients.
